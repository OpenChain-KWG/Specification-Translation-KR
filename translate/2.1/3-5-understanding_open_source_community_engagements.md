## 3.5 Understanding open source community engagements

### 3.5.1 Contributions
If an organization considers contributions to open source projects, then
* a written policy shall exist that governs contributions to open source projects; * the policy shall be internally communicated; and
* a process shall exist that implements the policy

#### Verification material(s):
If an organization permits contributions to open source projects, then the following shall exist:
* 3.5.1.1 A documented open source contribution policy;
* 3.5.1.2 A documented procedure that governs open source contributions; and
* 3.5.1.3 A documented procedure that makes all program participants aware of the existence of the
open source contribution policy (e.g., via training, internal wiki, or other practical communication method).

#### Rationale:
When an organization permits open source contributions, the intent is that the organization has given reasonable consideration to developing and implementing a contribution policy. The open source contribution policy can be made a part of the overall open source policy or be its own separate policy.
