## 3.6 Adherence to the specification requirements

### 3.6.1 Conformance
In order for a program to be deemed OpenChain conformant, the organization shall affirm that the program satisfies the requirements presented in this document.

#### Verification material(s):
* 3.6.1.1 A document affirming the program specified in §3.1.4 satisfies all the requirements of this document.

#### Rationale:
To ensure that if an organization declares that it has a program that is OpenChain conforming, that such program has met all the requirements of this document. The mere meeting of a subset of these requirements is not considered sufficient.

### 3.6.2 Duration
A program that is OpenChain conformant with this version of the specification shall last 18 months from the date conformance validation was obtained. The conformance validation registration procedure can be found on the OpenChain project’s website.

#### Verification material(s):

* 3.6.2.1 A document affirming the program meets all the requirements of this document, within the past 18 months of obtaining conformance validation.

#### Rationale:
It is important for a program to remain current with the specification if an organization wants to assert conformance over time. This requirement ensures that the program’s supporting processes and controls do not erode if an organization continues to assert program conformance over time.
