### 5.0 Understanding Open Source Community Engagements

#### 5.1        Contributions

**If an organization permits contributions to Open Source projects then**

- **a written policy exists that governs contributions to Open Source projects;**
- **the policy must be internally communicated; and**
- **a process exists that implements the policy**

##### Verification Material(s):

If an organization permits contributions to Open Source projects then the following must exist:

- 5.1.1 a documented Open Source contribution policy;
- 5.1.2 a documented procedure that governs Open Source contributions; and
- 5.1.3 a documented procedure that makes all Software Staff aware of the existence of the Open Source contribution policy (_e.g._, via training, internal wiki, or other practical communication method).

##### Rationale :

When an organization permits Open Source contributions we want to ensure the organization has given reasonable consideration to developing and implementing a contribution policy.  The Open Source contribution policy can be made a part of the overall Open Source policy or be its own separate policy.
