### 3.0 Open Source Content Review and Approval

#### 3.1       Bill of Materials

**A process exists for creating and managing a bill of materials that includes each Open Source component (and its Identified Licenses) from which the Supplied Software is comprised.**

##### Verification Material(s):

- 3.1.1 A documented procedure for identifying, tracking, reviewing, approving, and archiving information about the collection of Open Source components from which the Supplied Software is comprised.
- 3.1.2 Open Source component records for the Supplied Software that demonstrates the documented procedure was properly followed.

##### Rationale :

To ensure a process exists for creating and managing a Open Source component bill of materials used to construct the Supplied Software. A bill of materials is needed to support the systematic review and approval of each component&#39;s license terms to understand the obligations and restrictions as it applies to the distribution of the Supplied Software.



#### 3.2          License Compliance

**The Program must be capable of managing common Open Source license use cases encountered by Software Staff for Supplied Software, which may include the following use cases (note that the list is neither exhaustive, nor may all of the use cases apply):**

- **distributed in binary form;**
- **distributed in source form;**
- **integrated with other Open Source such that it may trigger copyleft obligations;**
- **contains modified Open Source;**
- **contains Open Source or other software under an incompatible license interacting with other components within the Supplied Software; and/or**
- **contains Open Source with attribution requirements.**

##### Verification Material(s):

- 3.2.1 A documented procedure for handling the common Open Source license use cases for the Open Source components of the Supplied Software.

##### Rationale :

To ensure the program is sufficiently robust to handle an organization&#39;s common Open Source license use cases.  That a procedure exists to support this activity and that the procedure is followed.
