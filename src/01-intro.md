## 1) Introduction

This specification defines the key requirements of a quality open source license compliance program. The objective is to provide a benchmark that builds trust between organizations exchanging software solutions comprised of open source software. Specification conformance provides assurance that a Program has been designed to produce the required Compliance Artifacts (_i.e._, legal notices, source code and so forth) for each software solution. The OpenChain Specification focuses on the &quot;what&quot; and &quot;why&quot; aspects of a Program rather than the &quot;how&quot; and &quot;when&quot;. This ensures flexibility for different organizations of different sizes in different markets to choose specific policy and process content that fits their size, goals and scope. For instance, an OpenChain Conformant Program may address a single product line or the entire organization.

This introduction provides the context for all potential users. Section 2 defines key terms used throughout the Specification. Section 3 defines the requirements that a Program must satisfy to achieve conformance. A requirement consists of one or more Verification Materials (_i.e._, records) that must be produced to satisfy the requirement. Verification Materials are not required to be made public, though an organization may choose to provide them to others, potentially under a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).

The Specification is developed as an open initiative with feedback received from over 150 contributors.
