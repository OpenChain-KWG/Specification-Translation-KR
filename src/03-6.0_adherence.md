### 6.0 Adherence to the Specification Requirements

#### 6.1        Conformance

**In order for a Program to be deemed OpenChain Conformant, the organization must affirm that the program satisfies the requirements presented in this specification.**

##### Verification Material(s):
- 6.1.1 A document affirming the Program specified in requirement 1.4 satisfies all the requirements of this specification.

##### Rationale :

To ensure that if an organization declares that it has a program that is OpenChain Conforming, that such program has met all the requirements of this specification. The mere meeting of a subset of these requirements would not be considered sufficient.



#### 6.2        Duration

**A Program that is OpenChain Conformant with this version of the specification will last 18 months from the date conformance validation was obtained. The conformance validation registration procedure can be found on the OpenChain project&#39;s website.**

##### Verification Material(s):

- 6.2.1 A document affirming the Program meets all the requirements of this version of the specification (version 2.0), within the past 18 months of obtaining conformance validation.

##### Rationale :

It is important for the organization to remain current with the specification if that organization wants to assert program conformance over time. This requirement ensures that the program&#39;s supporting processes and controls do not erode if an organization continues to assert program conformance over time.
