## Appendix I: Language Translations

To facilitate global adoption we welcome efforts to translate the specification into different languages. Because OpenChain functions as an open source project translations are driven by those willing to contribute their time and expertise to perform translations under the terms of the CC-BY-4.0 license and the project&#39;s translation policy.  The details of the policy and available translations can be found on the OpenChain project [specification webpage](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/openchain/spec-translations).
